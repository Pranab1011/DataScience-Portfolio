# DataScience-Portfolio
Portfolio of ongoing and completed datascience projects by me as a part of academic or self learning path. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks

## Contents
- **Exploratory data analysis and visual exploration**

  + [Gender Gap](https://github.com/Pranab1011/DataScience-Portfolio/tree/master/EDA%20and%20visual%20exploration/Gender%20Gap): A visual analysis on the gender gap in different academic degrees over the years
  
  + [Police activity in Florida](https://github.com/Pranab1011/DataScience-Portfolio/tree/master/EDA%20and%20visual%20exploration/Police%20activity%20Florida): An exploratory data analysis done on a dataset collected from stanford open data. The notebook shows how police activity changes based on different factors
  
- **Machine Learning**

  + [Box office revenue prediction](https://github.com/Pranab1011/DataScience-Portfolio/tree/master/ML%20Projects/Box%20office%20revenue%20prediction): Feature engineering techniques were implemented to create several new features from text data. Feature selection methods were used on over 3000 variables to run regression model on the transformed data. Error calculated was 10 percent
  + [Prediction of loan default](https://github.com/Pranab1011/DataScience-Portfolio/tree/master/ML%20Projects/The%20lending%20club): Exploratory data analysis was done on a loan applicationsâ€™ dataset. Extensive cleaning was done and gradient boosting classifiers were used in a highly inbalanced dataset to predict whether a loan goes default or not. PS: The notebook is yet to be updated
  + [Daily Bike rental prediction](https://github.com/Pranab1011/DataScience-Portfolio/tree/master/ML%20Projects/Bike%20rentals%20(decision%20trees)): A machine learning model to predict the number of bikes rented on daily basis
  + [Analysis of residential complaints](https://github.com/Pranab1011/DataScience-Portfolio/blob/master/ML%20Projects/311%20housing.ipynb): Extensive data exploration and visual analysis was done on a dataset released by NYC open data to answer a set of questions. Classifiers were applied to predict the type of complaint filed by the resident
  + [Sales prediction](https://github.com/Pranab1011/DataScience-Portfolio/tree/master/ML%20Projects/Big%20mart%20sales%20prediction%20(Linear%20regression)): A simple linear regression model to predict the store sales of big mart
  + [Heart disease](https://github.com/Pranab1011/DataScience-Portfolio/tree/master/ML%20Projects/Heart%20disease%20(logistic%20regression)): A logistic regression project to predict the class of heart disease using a sample of patient data
  
  
#### I have just started walking in the world of data sciences and exploring new things everyday. I will be doing many more projects in the near future. Currently I am planning to dive into natural language processing and deep learning. Hope you like what I am doing :)
